Summary of Machine Learning Project: Zomato Price Prediction using Linear Regression

In this machine learning project, the primary objective is to predict restaurant prices on Zomato, a popular online food delivery and restaurant discovery platform. The project revolves around solving a regression problem, where the target variable is the price of food items, and the goal is to build an accurate predictive model.

The project can be summarized into the following key steps:

**Data Exploration and Analysis**:
    The project begins with a thorough exploration and analysis of the dataset. This includes understanding the structure of the data, identifying missing values, handling outliers, and visualizing key features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset.
**Data Preprocessing**:
    To prepare the data for machine learning, various preprocessing steps are undertaken. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary. Data quality is improved to ensure the model's robustness.
**Feature Selection**:
    The selection of relevant features plays a crucial role in model performance. Feature selection techniques are applied to identify the most significant variables that influence restaurant prices.
**Model Building**:
    The core of the project involves creating a Linear Regression model. Linear Regression is chosen as the machine learning algorithm due to its simplicity and interpretability. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, using a portion of the data for training and the remaining for testing/validation.
**Model Evaluation**:
    The performance of the Linear Regression model is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. These metrics help assess how well the model predicts restaurant prices.
**Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    Depending on the initial model's performance, hyperparameter tuning may be performed to optimize the model's parameters and enhance its predictive accuracy.


**Documentation and Reporting**:
  Throughout the project, documentation of the process, findings, and results is maintained. A comprehensive report is generated to summarize the entire project, detailing the data preprocessing steps, model building process, and performance evaluation.
Overall, this machine learning project aims to leverage linear regression to predict Zomato restaurant prices accurately. By conducting extensive data analysis, preprocessing, and model building, it strives to provide valuable insights for pricing decisions on the Zomato platform, ultimately benefiting both users and restaurant owners.
